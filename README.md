<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Pathfinders Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://faberwerks.itch.io/pathfinders)

<p align="justify"><strong>Pathfinders</strong> is a puzzle game for the Android. Guide a group of explorers who all move at once out of an ancient temple, avoiding traps, removing obstacles, all the while collecting treasure and finding hidden relics. Some features of the game are:</p>

- <strong>Various obstacles</strong> - get past a variety of obstacles that stand between you and the goals!
- <strong>60 levels</strong> - explore (or rather, try to get out of) 60 different dungeons, each with their own challenges!
- <strong>Race against time</strong> - how quickly can you escape? Beat the target times! The faster the better!

<p align="justify">Pathfinders was Faberwerks' first and only mobile game and our first and only game published on the Google Play Store.</p> You can find the game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faberwerks.pathfinders">here</a>.
